  <h1>DevOps</h1>

  <p>
    DevOps is a combination of Development (Dev) and Operations (Ops). 
    It is a way of building and running software where both developers and operations teams work together. 
    The main goal of DevOps is to deliver software faster, with fewer errors, and with better quality.
  </p>

  <p>
    In DevOps, teams use automation to do tasks like building code, testing software, and deploying applications. 
    This makes the process quicker and reduces manual work. 
    Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) are common practices in DevOps. 
    They help in updating applications regularly without big delays.
  </p>

  <p>
    DevOps also focuses on monitoring applications after they are released. 
    Tools are used to watch performance, fix problems, and make improvements. 
    This ensures that users get reliable and stable software.
  </p>

  <p>
    Popular DevOps tools include Git for version control, Jenkins for integration, Docker for containers, 
    Kubernetes for orchestration, Ansible for configuration, and Prometheus with Grafana for monitoring.
  </p>

  <p>
    The benefits of DevOps are faster delivery, better teamwork, fewer failures, and improved customer satisfaction. 
    It is used by many companies to stay competitive and to keep their services running smoothly.
